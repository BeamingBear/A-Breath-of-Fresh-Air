<My idea for code.fun.do 2018>
TO PREDICT NATURAL DISASTERS, MAINLY STORMS and CYCLONES using BIRD BEHAVIOURAL DATA
India suffers from a lot of storms and flood related disasters every year.
They are followed by a lot of casualities and property damage/loss.
My idea aims at creating an additional layer of warning systems to complement traditional cyclone/storm warning systems.
The idea is to take image data of birds in flight or in their natural habitat and using an algorithm to look for signs of the behaviour deviation from the normal.
Bird flight patterns are usually stable and orderly, following a certain rhythm. But in many recorded cases, birds have been known to behave erratically about a few days before a storm, in many cases.They have been known to change flight patterns and also have been known to fly in the direction opposite the storm.
The analysis of these cases show that although it is not a sure-fire method of predicting storms, they may be able to give a whole new take on predicting the same. This may then be correlated with local weather data, GIS data, RRSC data etc. to converge on the impendening disaster slighty in advance.
The advantage that this idea has is that it may be potentially be able to give highly localized and relevant data to the about-to-be affected areas as opposed to the general methods currently being employed.
Also the idea is applicable for nearly all natural disasters. Birds and other creatures including ants show a large change in behaviour before natural disasters such as forest fires and earthquakes.
The idea can also be applied in a similar fashion with the help of fishing communities to analyze fish behaviour before sea storms, cyclones and tsunamis.
The hardware of this idea is a small device that can be hung outside windows, on streetlights and on tall towers. It may be also be putup in large open spaces and in areas with high bird activity.
The plan of action is to use computer vision and collect data from bird behaviour either in flight or in natural habitat and analyze for disturbance in daily behaviour.
Machine Learning is to be employed to smartly converge onn emerging patterns.
Then either via Wifi or cell signal, this information can be stored in a centralized server.
Technologies proposed to be used are OpenCV YOLO object detection, ROS for creating server nodes and effective data communication and MATLAB/Tensorflow for ML application.
